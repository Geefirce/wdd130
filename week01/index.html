        <h2>Lagos Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="./images/lagos.webp" alt="Photo" width="400">
        <p>Today, Lagos is a sprawling megacity on the southwestern coast of Nigeria, a relentless hub of economic
            activity, cultural vibrancy, and sheer human energy. As the most populous city in Africa and the second most
            populous state in Nigeria (despite being the smallest in land area), Lagos pulsates with life.

            It's the undisputed commercial and financial capital of Nigeria,
            home to major industries, bustling markets,
            and a thriving entrepreneurial spirit.
            The city's landscape is a dynamic mix of modern skyscrapers and sprawling urban areas,
            connected by a network of often congested roads and an ever-evolving infrastructure.

            Culturally, Lagos is a powerhouse.
            It's the heart of Nollywood, Nigeria's prolific film industry,
            and boasts a rich musical heritage, still echoing with the sounds of Afrobeat.
            The city's nightlife is legendary, and its art scene is constantly evolving.

            Despite the challenges of rapid urbanization,
            including traffic and infrastructure limitations,
            Lagos remains a magnet for people from across Nigeria and beyond,
            drawn by its opportunities and its undeniable dynmism.
            It's a city of contrasts, where affluence and poverty often exist side-by-side,
            but where the spirit of resilience and innovation is palpable.
            Lagos today is a city that never sleeps,constantly reinventing itself and firmly holding its position as a
            key player on the African continent.</p>
